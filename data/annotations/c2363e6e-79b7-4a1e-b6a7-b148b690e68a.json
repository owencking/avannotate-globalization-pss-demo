After all, the corn brooms that the company produced would lose tariff protections once the deal was enacted. However, the report explains that the impact on the company was less dramatic, though still significant. It now operated with around 100 workers, less than half the number of pre-NAFTA employees, and now the mop yarn and broom parts used at the factory come from Pakistan and China rather than the USA. As Factory President Ed Pearson put it, “Ironically, the Chinese are saving jobs in this factory from Mexico.”"

As the chart shows, manufacturing employment has fallen by more than 40% since its peak in 1980, an outcome that has been blamed on globalization. However, the value of manufacturing output has continued to climb since 1980. Thus, terms like “deindustrialization” can be slightly misleading as manufacturing production continues to increase. However, the US manufacturing sector is, put simply, making more things with fewer workers. Automation is a crucial element in this story. Factory robots like the ones pictured in this piece do much of the labor that human factory workers once did."
