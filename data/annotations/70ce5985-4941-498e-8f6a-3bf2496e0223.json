Notably, Gifford was a famous celebrity with a bubbly personality who was watched by millions of Americans daily rather than a “faceless” corporation. This tearful television moment galvanized public attention, and the scandal ultimately drove Gifford to speak out against the use of child labor and call for independent monitors of working conditions in the developing world."

He targeted high-profile companies like Walmart, Nike, and Target for sourcing their products from suppliers in the developing world that exploited their workers. While some businesses accused him of exaggerating abuses, his use of interviews with workers and hidden camera footage compellingly documented abuses and galvanized activists. The documentaries he created (which provided footage used by major broadcasters like PBS) heavily influenced the public debate in this era."

According to this perspective, the “sweatshops” offer wages that (while very low by American standards) are competitive in poor countries that have lower costs of living. They argue that the shift of garment manufacturing has actually reduced extreme poverty in the developing world and provided economic opportunity that wouldn’t otherwise exist."

While the shift of operations overseas is often viewed as the result of business choices, it must also be viewed as the accumulation of millions of individual consumer choices. As consumers increasingly choose lower priced goods that are produced in other countries, businesses and entrepreneurs are incentivized to shift operations overseas and  invest in low-wage countries. The economic trends are the result of interplay between producer and consumer behavior."
