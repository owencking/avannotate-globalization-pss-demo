However, the deal had yet to be approved by Congress when Bush was defeated in the 1992 election by Bill Clinton. The new Democratic president continued to advocate for NAFTAâ€™s passage in 1993. The trade deal faced opposition from both sides of the political aisle, but resistance was particularly strong among Democrats."
