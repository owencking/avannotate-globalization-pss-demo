The trade deal faced opposition from both sides of the political aisle, but resistance was particularly strong among Democrats."

Imagine that a US business wanted to open a new factory in Mexico, and felt that the Mexican government was treating it unfairly, or was subjecting the factory to treatment that Mexican companies did not experience. NAFTA set up rules for how a government could and couldn’t treat investors from other member nations, and procedures that would allow an investor to appeal if they felt that a government was treating them unfairly. These provisions were meant to encourage foreign investment, since a business would be more likely to engage in economic activity in another country if they felt they would be treated fairly by that country’s government. (Conversely, critics say that such provisions put the interests of a multinational corporation ahead of the democratic power of the government in which that company operated)."

Most unauthorized immigrants in that era were coming from Mexico for economic opportunity—seeking American jobs that were low-paid by American standards but were attractive to Mexican immigrants given their relatively poorer economy. Defenders of NAFTA argued that economic migrants would be less likely to immigrate to the United States, if the trade deal created more economic opportunity in Mexico. While this case made some sense, many commentators argued that NAFTA surprisingly had the opposite effect. The trade agreement led to a surge of American farm goods entering the Mexican market, and those American crops proved cheaper to Mexican consumers than the crops produced in Mexico. As a result, many rural Mexicans lost their livelihoods, and moved north (sometimes without authorization) to the United States."

This resistance posed a political problem for Bill Clinton, as unions were a key part of the Democratic coalition. Ultimately, Democrats and Republicans came together to approve NAFTA."

He took nineteen percent of the popular vote which was the highest for a third party since 1912. Perot’s favorability shows the appeal of free trade skepticism in the American public."

Much of this resistance arose from environmentalists and labor unions on Clinton’s political left. Environmentalists argued that trade deals like NAFTA would result in environmental destruction, as American companies would take advantage of laxer environmental regulations in developing countries. Labor unions argued that multinational companies would exploit workers in poorer countries. As a result, the workers and environment of other countries would be harmed, and American workers would lose their jobs. These “side agreements” responded to these concerns, building more protections for the environment and workers in other countries, and providing training programs for American workers displaced by NAFTA."
